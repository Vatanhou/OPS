Reflection

Since I was new to coding, I decide to put focus into making the website and not much of the content. Resulting in a summery of the original website in the reference above.

Although I had wrappers around my texts, I think having a column/grid to designate my text would've been a good way to space text and make it cross compatible. 

give my Css layout, some codes can be inefficient since it is reading a bunch of a code doing the same thing. In saying that, I believe that it is easy to follow.

So far, I've tackle my image problems by going into photoshop and changing the scale or the "blur" but ideally I would like to do more purely in Css

Finally, one of my biggest issue is knowing where to look to begin with. I find it hard to search up anything given that people refer to them in a specific way such as an "accordion" which I would have never guessed.
