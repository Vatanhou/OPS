                    <p id="text07">Aforementioned cases were dwarfed by a large wildfire in Victoria in 2007. The fire burned for several weeks and covered an area about one million hectares. An unofficial estimate cost over $900 million.</p>
                    <p id="text08">The 2016 fire disaster at Yarloop virtually destroyed the town and two lives were lost. And after 2 years, local people were still suffering trauma distress from the fire. Infrastructure losses include over 160 homes destroyed and with an estimated cost of $26 million in restoring electrical network by Western Power.</p>

Some are Ash-type eucalypt forests are killed in this way but drier forest type, such as Jarrah in WA are not destroyed but severly damaged. Most eucalypt have a number of specialised features that enable recovery from intense fire. The growth layer under the bark (Cambium) may be killed in one side of bole, resulting in a "dry sides" which are prone to insect attack. Furthermore, Rots also gain entry via dry side and burnt limps.In the case of Pine, which are dependent for timber supplies in WA. The log may also be degraded for certain end uses by charcoal. Such destruction of immature plantations distrupts the flow of future timber supplies.</p>
